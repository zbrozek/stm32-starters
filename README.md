# SSCP starter codebase
Sasha Zbrozek

## Motivation
This project was born out of years of helping out Stanford Solar Car Project
students with their embedded software development. It's designed and intended
to make it easy for them to start work on a new car with a clean codebase.
Despite that pedigree, it's likely useful to other teams and for other uses.

## What's in here?
It includes starter projects and a handful of drivers for low-level hardware
that SSCP has frequently used over the years.

There are also repackagings of the ST-provided abstraction layer and CPU support
files. The directory structure has been flattened and many files have been
omitted for clarity.

FreeRTOS and its TCP, CLI, and FAT modules are also included.
